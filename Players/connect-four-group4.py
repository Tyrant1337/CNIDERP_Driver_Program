##Group 4: Engineering?
##Team Lead: Julia
##Members: Daniel, Davis, Kat, Sharvita
##
##Will play Connect 4 on any dimension semi
##intelligently.
##**DEMO VERSION: FOR 4/15/2019 CLASS ONLY**
##**NOT A FINISHED PRODUCT**
##**Makes zero guarantee of winning
##**Has been tested using provided driver/graphical environment
##**and plays nicely, does not crash and CAN play to a draw.
##**Has NOT been tested using any other driver/graphical setup.
##
## a) Uncommenting elif vert_ok in s:  meh.append(r)
##will give vertical and horizontal same weight.
## b) Include the following two sections to give
##horizontal offence and defence same weight:
##elif player not in hor and flag == 0 and 0 not in under:
##and
##elif player not in hor and flag == 1:
##
##Areas of improvement:
## 1) List of meh moves can be handled better.  Instead
##of giving all moves equal weight before randomy
##choosing, maybe reduce list to single best meh move
##and just return that list of one element.  Also
##meh can be expanded to build more sequences.
## 2) Meh only plays offense, maybe include defensive
##strategy?
## 3) List of ok moves still doesn't check if row
##beneath is properly populated.
## 4) Before removing element from moves list
##ensure its absolutely necessary.
##
##Might play around with:
## 1) All the opening if else/if statements to ensure list meh
##gets a lot of moves, see 1 from above.
##
##**STRANGE ISSUE I DONT UNDERSTAND AND CANT DUPLICATE!
##**ALSO UNSURE IF EVEN STILL EXISTS, NEED MORE TESTING
##After changing board dimensions via
##gui Edit->Preferences Width or Row, algo SOMETIMES returns a
##full column and crashes game.  This does not always happen.
##Changing dimensions inside graphical-driver.rkt at
##define HEIGHT and define WIDTH does not cause this behavior.
##Maybe because changes to .rkt file need save and then reload
##of game board to take effect??
